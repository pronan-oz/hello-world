# hello-world
1st repository
Hi, this is my first attempt at a repository. I am learning how to code so that I can start a new career. I am an electrical engineer. The company that I work for is currently going through a restructure and my position is being made redundant. I am looking at learning to code so that I can change careers and be closer to my family instead of having to spend 5 days a week away from home.
